Based on our current study, write a concise yet comprehensive review of how societal trends in urban development have evolved over time due to globalization. In your response, integrate the influence and impacts these changes could potentially bring upon local ecosystem services by evaluating their effects at each stage:

Document Text 

In an era wherein tourism has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry in Southeast Asia (Jones et al., n. d.) with over $60 billion injected annually, the globalization of culture is often seen as one way to strengthen local economies and foster cultural understanding among communities while also creating environmental concerns like urban sprawl on rural tourism destinations such as Kyrgyzstan's Issyk-Kul lake region. The purpose of this article will be an in-depth exploration into the impactful effects that these economic activities have had historically, focusing primarily upon: (i) how climate change and globalization might influence them;

In a world where tourism is one of Kyrgyzstan's main income sources with nearly 3.2 billion dollars in revenue annually for the country buttressing its economy while generating about USD $856 million to local communities, yet it has been reported that there are over fifty percent less than a third as many domestic tourists compared to other regions worldwide and this number might grow exponentially with time (Cullen & Sutton 2019). In the wake of recent environmental concerns like climate change or pollution on national parks, we have seen an increasing demand for sustainable ecotourism in Kyrgyzstan. A unique ecosystem such as Lake Issyk-Kul is particularly vulnerable to climatic changes with its diverse topography and abundant biodiversity that provide a myriad of habitats hosting various species, like the snow leopard (Panthera unchainedis) native only in this region. 

In Kyrgyzstan's case there are about seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites within its borders where unique flora and fauna coexist along with indigenous communities that thrive on the land, thus creating a beautiful tourist attraction for visitors worldwide to visit (Jones et al., 2015). As it is home to many important lakes like Kyzyltu Lake in Issyk-Kul and its unique culture of nomadic lifestyles. However, due to the country's economic development that includes a growing urban population which has increased by almost twofold during recent years (Ikeda et al., 2021). The tourism industry is set to contribute more than half of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP and thus there exist significant opportunities for ecotourism in this region. To explore the sustainable utilization potential, we will focus on three ecological resources (i.0m) - water supply from a lake or river basin with clean drinking water sources; freshwater fish species that provide food and livelihoods to local populations while improving biodiversity in this area of Kyrgyzstan’s far-flung villages such as Karakol, Dzhankoy.

As an environmental scientist interested in sustainable development and tourism, I am researching on the impact that ecotourism could bring to these natural resources along with their socioeconomic significance for local communities within Kyrgyzstan's Lake Issyk-Kul region (Akbar et al., 2018). The country’s cultural heritage and biodiversity have been overlooked as a crucial determinant of the wellbeing of its inhabitants. I am interested in how ecotourism tourists can support sustainable local development without harm to nature (Rosemary et al., 2015). In this paper, we present ongoing research that analyses various ecological and socio-economic aspects of Lake Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan. The most notable issue regarding ecotourism impacts associated with the lake is its potential to undermine sustainability (Rosenberg et al., 2019). In this paper, we examine how tourists can engage more effectively and responsibly through environmental education programs that provide knowledge of biodiversity conservation for local communities in developing countries.

I need help with a highly specific document-based question based on the given instruction above using at least two additional constraints to enhance its complexity, focusing specifically on 'Situatedness' and incorporating all aspects from my request while avoiding any reference to biodiversity or fauna as themes: 

Document text:

In a recent study by Duflo & Jones (2023), it is estimated that ecotourism, if conducted without adequate management practices and awareness of the local culture’s role in preserving unique biodiversity within this ecosystem. The country's economy heavily depends on tourists who visit Lake Issyk-Kul for their leisure purposes (Goranov et al., 2019). In fact, studies show that with appropriate management strategies, ecotourism could contribute to upwards of USD $4.5 billion annually by sustaining local economies and improving the ecological health of this region which hosts a number significant wetlands (Boroday et al., 2023). In light of tourists' preferences, we have been studying how to enhance ecotourism potentials in Lake Issyk-Kul. Touristic development around water has become the top agenda for Kyrgyzstan’s national parks as well as being a unique feature that is conduci0usly attractive and interesting but it poses great risk to natural resources, including lake environments (Miranda et al., 2014). To date there remains little research on how ecotourism tourism in Kyrgyzstan can impact the Lake Issyk-Kul area’s biodiversity.

As a result of its unique characteristics as an endemic hotspot, we propose to develop this article by exploring three key aspects: (1) The concept and implications for development of ecotourism in Kyrgyzstan within the region; (2) How eco-friendly practices are essential when designing a sustainable management system that is socially responsible towards indigenous cultures, which often rely on Lake Issyk-Kul as their primary water source for life support and spiritual activities. This study has implications in both local tourism policy development to ensure the preservation of Kyrgyzstan's natural resources (Nikolaeva et al., 2019).

Our purpose is not only economic gains but also cultural-social impact; thus, ecotourists’ presence can increase awareness and improve living standards. As the world moves towards greater eco-friendly practices due to climate change effects on human activities that negatively affecting nature (Miranda et al., 2015). This article attempts to present an incisive approach to ecotourism which integrates all these issues and promotes a holistic view of the impacts. Ecotourism as well contributes not only ecological but also socio-economic benefits for local communities, where tourists learn about their culture (Cooke et al., 2014). This article explores ecotourism in Kyrgyzstan's Issyk-Kul region. I am interested to know more on how the country’s rich natural and cultural heritage can be balanced with economic development that is not at odds with conservation efforts, which are necessary for creating a sustainable future of ecotourism (Sun et al., 2019).

This study will investigate these issues by evaluating the positive/negative impact of tourists visiting Issyk-Kul Lake and its surr0werd based on:  
• Identifying challenges for local communities;     - 'Ecotourism' is a key concept in sustainable development as it represents an important way to preserve, conserve & improve natural resources while respecting environmental values that are fundamental. We studied ecotourists’ perception of the ecosystem services provided by Lake Issyk-Kul lake and their importance for household wastewater reuse systematically

The article draws on the results of myriad studies that demonstrate how ecotourists’ perceptions can contribute towards understanding their preferences about ecosystem services (Kirchherr et al., 2019). Increased accessibility, with more than half a billion dollars in tourist revenues annually.

As this study investigated the impact of ecotourism on Kyrgyzstan's environment and how these experiences have evolved during their visitation behavior to Lake Issyk-Kul (Aktobe et al., 2018). However, I also identify three primary factors that contribute.
